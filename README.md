Flixberry CharacterView AI transforms a single character image into four playful views—front, back, left, and right—powered by Chrome’s built-in AI. It runs entirely in the browser with no cloud, no backend, and no setup—designed to help creators work faster and more intuitively.

Whether you're building manhua, webtoons, manga, or animated content, this tool streamlines character design and saves hours of manual work.

## 📚 Project Story

This project was inspired by the daily grind of character design. Whether you're building a new comic series or animating scenes for kids’ content, creating consistent multi-angle views takes time. I wanted to make that process faster, easier, and more fun—especially for solo creators and small teams.

Built entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, CharacterView runs in Chrome Canary and is scaffolded for Chrome’s Prompt API. While the API is not yet exposed, the app includes fallback logic and mock views to simulate the final experience.

This project is part of a larger vision at Flixberry to simplify creative workflows and empower storytellers through joyful, privacy-first tools.
